A scripting interface for the Java Debugger Interface (JDI).  

Right now, jdiscript provides:

- An event-loop/dispatcher that allows you to specify handlers to respond to
  events from particular EventRequests.
  
- A set of interfaces and a dynamic proxy for chaining Request configuration 
  method calls.
  
- A set of single-method handler interfaces that are easy to implement as 
  closures in several of the higher-level languages.
  
- Utility classes for launching a new VM and handling its process input and
  output, or attaching to an existing VM.
  
- A top-level script object that allows transparent use of jdiscript features
  and easy access to frequently used operations.


jdiscript is intended to be used by whichever higher-level JVM language you 
prefer, and is itself pure Java, with no dependencies outside of jdk6.  Some 
sample Groovy scripts are provided to get you started, but there's no reason 
you couldn't use JRuby, Clojure, Scala, etc.  If you run into problems with 
your language of choice, or you have ideas for how a common idiom in your 
language could be better supported by the underlying Java implementation, 
please let me know.  

I'd also love to start collecting generally useful scripts into one place, and 
creating a comprehensive debugging catalogue that anyone can dip into to help
troubleshoot their code more efficiently.  If you have one you'd like to share, 
drop it into a gist and link to it from the [wiki page](http://wiki.github.com/jfager/jdiscript/useful-jdiscripts).
